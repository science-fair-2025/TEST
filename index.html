        <h2>Can AI Create a Website?</h2>

        <div class="section" id="introduction">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In this project, we explore whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can create a website from scratch. We will analyze the tools and methods used by AI to generate HTML code and see how effectively it can build a functional and aesthetically pleasing website.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="project-description">
            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>The goal of this project is to determine the capabilities of AI in creating a website. We'll be using an AI tool that generates HTML code for a website based on user input. The AI's code will be tested for accuracy, design, and usability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="methodology">
            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p>The steps followed for this experiment are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1: Research AI tools that can generate website code.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Provide the AI with a set of instructions and see how it performs.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Evaluate the AI-generated code for correctness and structure.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Test the resulting website for functionality and design quality.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="results">
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>The AI was able to generate a complete HTML code for a website based on input provided. The generated website is functional and follows basic HTML structure. However, improvements could be made to enhance the layout and design, which may require human intervention.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, AI can indeed create a website, but human supervision is beneficial to ensure the quality of design and structure. AI tools are valuable for speeding up web development, but the creative and detailed aspects of website creation may still rely on human expertise.</p>
